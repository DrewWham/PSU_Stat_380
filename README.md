## Communication
### Piazza

We will be using Piazza for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each other’s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and professor. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmates’ questions when you can. Note that you may choose to post questions or comments to Piazza anonymously if you wish. Piazza may also be used for course announcements.

Do Not use Piazza for issues related to your grade or other private matters (not even an instructor post); email those questions or comments to the instructor directly or discuss them in person.

### Email

Most issues about classroom activities can be posted to Piazza, but you should use email (or a conversation in person) for all personal or private matters.

### Grading
Learning outcomes will be assessed based on performance in each of the following categories accompanied by their impact on the overall grade:

* 30% Completing Weekly Activities (in-class and HW)
* 20% Performance on Weekly Activities
* 10% Reading Quizzes
* 20% Midterm Project Results
* 20% Final Project Results



### In-Class Assignments

Weekly in-class assignments will include an activity assigned and completed in part or whole during class. The format and length of in-class assignments will vary as warranted by the subject matter each week, although each assignments will be given the same weight toward the overall grade. There are no make-up assignments.

### Reading Quizzes

Reading quizzes will be due before class in order to assess comprehension of the reading assignment that will be discussed each week. This allows students to see new content and concepts for the first time at their own pace in order to more effectively use class time to emphasize main points, clear up confusion, etc. The goal of the reading quiz is to hold students accountable for completing the reading each week before class.

## Course Description and Objectives
### Description

The official course description is available in Penn State’s University Bulletin [linked here](https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=all&search=stat+380&caturl=%2Fundergraduate), but a recent version is reproduced below for your convenience.

A case study-based course in the use of computing and statistcal reasoning to answer data-intensive questions. STAT 380 Data Science Through Statistical Reasoning and Computation (3) This course addresses the fact that real data are often messy by taking a holistic view of statistical analysis to answer questions of interest. Various case studies will lead students from the computationally intensive process of obtaining and cleaning data, through exploratory techniques, and finally to rudimentary inferential statistics. This process will exploit students exposure to introductory statistics as well as the R programming language, hence the required prerequisites, yet novel computing and analytical techniques will also be introduced throughout the course. For the collection of data, students will learn scripting and database querying skills; for their exploration, they will employ R capabilities for graphical and summary statistics; and for their analysis, they will build upon the basic concepts obtained in their introductory statistics course. The varied case studies will elucidate additional statistical topics such as identifying sources of bias and searching for high-dimensional outliers.

## Policies & Resources
### Working collaboratively
All quizes and tests must be done individualy without the aid of other students. In-class activities may be discussed in groups but must be completed individualy. Submissions will require the submission of code, the first line of code must always contain a commented out author line. Making a submission without code that is able to produce the exact submission will invalidate the submission. Turning in code with an author line that does not reflect the origins of the work is a violation of academic integrity.  

### ECoS Code of Mutual Respect
The Eberly College of Science [Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation](http://science.psu.edu/climate/support-and-resources/code-of-mutual-respect-and-cooperation-pdf) embodies the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess and will endorse to make the Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded.

### Academic Integrity Statement
Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following is quoted directly from the “PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students” regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty:

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.
All University and Eberly College of Science policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the academic integrity policies of the Eberly College of Science: http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html. Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by University and Eberly College of Science policies about academic integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in assignment of “F” by the course instructors or “XF” by Judicial Affairs as the final grade for the student.

### Disability Policy
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact Student Disability Resources (SDR; formerly ODS) at 814-863-1807, 116 Boucke, http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources. In order to receive consideration for course accommodations, you must contact ODS and provide documentation (see the guidelines at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/guidelines).
